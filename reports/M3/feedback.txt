Hi team, good decissions regarding your data rep.
The method you described sounds reasonable. However, 
I'm really concerned that you have not started training any
model yet. Please start on this ASAP as it may bring new challenges.
I would suggest you put more attention on your model than UI, at least for now
until you have a working version of your model.
