Hi team, good progress. I understand that your project is a challenging 
one and you are doing well in terms of researching. But keep in 
mind that clock is ticking so you need to start implementing and testing with a 
neural network soon. Since your project is challenging, don't forget to break it 
down into easier tasks. For example, predicting the notes as a one hot encoded 
vector seems reasonable. Converting the predicted notes to a music sheet can 
then be done as a non-ML component. 
Converting audio to pictures and using an already designed convolutional NN 
such as ResNet seems like a reasonable thing to try as well. However, due to the 
sequential nature of musics, I can see why a recurrent network might be combined
to improve the result once you got the first network running.
One important part of your project would be the loss function. Don't forget to 
invest some time into researching what loss function would be reasonable 
for this task.
Lastly, if you had a hard time thinking what should be the next step, feel free ask for a meeting with TAs on Piazza and we will try to help
